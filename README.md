## Instructor: [Dan Wellman][instructor url]


UI-Router is a flexible and powerful alternative for AngularJS routing. UI-Router goes beyond what the Angular team's own ngRoute module by building in support for nested routes and for events triggered by route changes.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Dan Wellman will show you how to build a client-side routing strategy using the ui-router framework for Angular. You'll follow along with Dan as he builds a single page app (SPA) in angular for displaying and editing contacts. Along the way, you'll learn how to use some of the advanced features of UI-Router.
